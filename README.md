# BME280 module

> CAUTION: This component's implementation initializes the I2C bus directly and assumes it is the sole device with control of the bus. Do not use in conjunction with the [Viam Board Component](https://docs.viam.com/operate/reference/components/board/) APIs for I2C or other devices on the same bus.

The BME280 is as combined digital humidity, pressure and temperature sensor based on proven sensing principles. 
The sensor module is housed in an extremely compact metal-lid LGA package with a footprint of only 2.5 × 2.5 mm² with a height of 0.93 mm. 
Its small dimensions and its low power consumption allow the implementation in battery driven devices such as handsets, GPS modules or watches.

[Datasheet](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bme280-ds002.pdf)

This module utilizes the [Viam Sensor Component](https://docs.viam.com/operate/reference/components/sensor/) API and acts as a wrapper around the [BME280 ESP-IDF Component](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/bme280).

## Configuration

This component utilizes the following configuration attributes:
- `i2c_bus`: The I2C bus initialized on the board (defaults to `0`)
- `scl_pin`: The `SCL` I2C clock pin (defaults to `22`)
- `sda_pin`: The `SDA` IC2 data pin (defaults to `21`)
